## To Do

### Render engine (Blender promo renders)

- [ ] Bundle or download-on-first-run a portable Blender (GPL allows shipping it as a separate CLI process; include license + source link). Detector already checks exe-relative `Resources/blender/`.
- [ ] Batch render mode: manifest of many minis in ONE Blender launch (see raw/HANDOVER.md, biggest speed win for terabyte-scale cataloging)
- [ ] Store chosen rotation in model metadata (`model.json`) so catalog re-renders don't need repositioning
- [ ] Scale reference figure / true-scale rendering (handover roadmap; current look normalizes size)
- [ ] Measured geometry into model.json (NOT a separate sidecar): dimensions mm, part count, chosen rotation — computed at render/parse time, stored in the same model.json the 3pk manifest and scanner already round-trip, so it becomes searchable catalog metadata for free
- [x] Promo overlay compositing: branding (logo image + title/credit text) now bakes into the output PNG after Blender finishes — the webview composites on a canvas (same font engine as the preview = guaranteed WYSIWYG; no bundled fonts, no Rust glyph layout), Rust writes it back atomically with PNG-magic + exists guards. Ink color auto-picks dark/light by sampling the pixels under the text.
- [ ] render_mini.py uses `use_nodes` (deprecated, removal in Blender 6.0) — needs a tweak when 6.x lands
- [ ] Parse STLs in a Web Worker: mergeVertices on million-triangle minis still freezes the main thread during load (the overlay paints now, but a worker would keep the UI fully responsive)

- [ ] ARCHITECTURE: Currently we are only storing the paths in the json, but in doing so also reduce the info available in the UI. The data in the UI should be complete. From creation dont throw away the data too soon and when revisiting compose the UI info from the json PLUS the underlying jsons.
- [x] Add checkboxes to release fields to store the field data permanently like settings (so creators dont have to type in their own name every time for example) — "Remember for future releases" on Designer; stored in settings as `release_field_defaults` (a map, so more fields are one-liners)
- [ ] use TAR+Zstd for local compression and cataloging
- [x] default releasedate current? — MonthYear form field now defaults to the current month
- [x] recover/continue mode (quick so testing becomes less tedious!) — draft (staged models + step + release) snapshots to localStorage from the store; unsaved details form mirrors separately; both restore on launch with a toast
- [ ] Combine safety: group_renames match scanner group names globally — combining a generically-named group ("Spear") can capture same-named groups from other releases. Scope renames (e.g. per release subtree) or warn when a source name is ambiguous
- [ ] On-disk normalizer/cleaner: physically restructure folders so the disk matches the curated catalog (pose assignments, renames) — preview-first dry-run diff, then file-level moves extending batch_move_models (deliverable 4 of the normalization plan)
- [ ] Compressed-at-rest option: after cleanup, keep each model bundled on disk (pack/unpack on demand) to save space while staying workable — the finalize_release compression path is the seed tech
- [ ] Remaining catalog filter facets: year (from release date), release name, and category (new concept, still TBD) — designer facet + grouping shipped 2026-07-05
- [ ] Print modal: list the model's files with checkboxes so the user picks which to send to the slicer (today PRINT sends all printable files / reveals folder)
- [ ] docs/CATALOG.md is outdated: documented model.json shape lacks pose/scale/support/file-variants that the code now writes and scans — source of truth is StlModel + the scanner's meta parse

### Duplicate handling — share, don't delete (hardlink dedup)

Duplicates across variants (e.g. one base STL repeated in 5 weapon variants) should be stored once but stay present in every variant. Mechanism: hardlinks (one inode/file-ID, a real directory entry per variant) so print, render, packing, and Finder all keep working with no resolution layer. UI never says hardlink/inode/hash — the user sees "Merge — free X MB" and "shared by N variants".

- [x] Phase 1 — inode-aware catalog: `files.file_identity` (opaque "device:inode"/volume:index string via `file-id` crate, refreshed each dup scan); `duplicate_groups()` reports `distinct_copies` so same-inode groups read as shared (reclaimable 0); `stats()` subtracts hardlink savings
- [x] Phase 2 — "merge — free X" beside "delete copies": full-hash verify both sides (refuses files that diverged since the scan), hardlink keeper → hidden temp in dup's dir, atomic rename over dup, identities refreshed in place. Per-volume probe (`supports_file_links` makes a real test link — ground truth for NAS/SMB/exFAT) gates the buttons; link-less volumes get delete-only + plain-language hint. "merge all" batches every group
- [x] Phase 3 — print-to-slicer: `print_action` setting, default `open-in-slicer` (`openPath` per file → OS-default slicer; pre-sliced .lys/.chitu beat raw stl/obj/3mf when present) vs `reveal-folder` (the old flow, for multi-slicer users); toggle in Settings
- [x] Phase 4 — 3pk checksum dedup: `compress_files` stores each unique blake3 blob once (size-prefiltered, one read for unique-size files) and returns per-entry checksums; manifest lists every name against its checksum with `component.dedup` marking elision (spec'd in docs/3PK.md); `manifest::extract_component_archive` rematerializes elided names (hardlink where supported, else copy) — wired into pack, awaiting the reconstruction UI on the import side
- [ ] Phase 5 (only if real users are stuck on link-less volumes) — virtual sharing tier: catalog-pointer fallback, viable once print resolves paths in-app; Finder browsing is the only remaining gap
- [ ] Cleanup-tooling contract: same-volume `rename()` preserves links; deleting a variant folder only drops one name; cross-volume moves split shared inodes — cleaner must re-merge on the destination side

### 3pk writer (spec + reader done; see docs/3PK.md)

The format (`manifest::Manifest` structs + BLAKE3) and the scanner-side reader
(rich `model.json` → catalog, incl. per-file poses) are built. The writer is
the remaining half and depends on the release-builder flow settling first.

- [x] Enrich what `add_model` writes to `model.json`: `StlModel` carries the full curation (variant/pose/scale/support/designer/sculptor/release_name/release_date + `file_poses`), `addToDraftRelease` stages it from the catalog (incl. per-file assignments filtered to the member's own files), `add_model` passes it through untouched, and `pack_manifest` maps it onto `ManifestModel`/`ManifestFile` (with release-level fallbacks for designer/date/name). `ManifestModel` gained the additive `variant` field.
- [x] Container `manifest.json` in `release.3pk`: one component per group with a BLAKE3 archive checksum + per-file checksums, built at pack time (`file/pack_manifest.rs`, sequenced components → manifest → 3pk in `compression_jobs`) with the Phase-4 checksum-dedup folded in. Emits null for the fields `model.json` doesn't carry yet — filled by the enrichment bullet above.
- [x] Wire the finalize flow to emit the manifest and verify round-trip: finalize packs manifest.json into release.3pk; `import_release` verifies checksums, extracts with dedup rematerialized, and the scanner restores curation from the sidecars. Tested end-to-end (pack → import → tree + curation intact; tampered archive refused).

### Modular Package Strategy Implementation

- [ ] Create a modular compression system that packages each group separately
- [ ] Create update detection system that compares local files with metadata checksums
- [ ] Add selective download functionality to only retrieve changed/new components
- [x] Reconstruction v1: opening/dropping a release.3pk imports it — confirm dialog → library dir (catalog root default) → checksum-verified extraction → auto-scan restores curation. (Selective per-component UI still open below.)
- [ ] Implement preview generation for .3dpak files (thumbnail/icon)
- [ ] Create documentation for creators explaining the modular release strategy
- [ ] Add bandwidth estimation and progress indicators for partial downloads
- [x] Implement integrity verification for downloaded components (import_release refuses any component whose archive bytes don't match the manifest's blake3)
- [ ] Create a manifest generator that builds the .3dpak file from component ZIPs
